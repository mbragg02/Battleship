###Created by Michael Bragg, David North, Joseph Watkins, Oliver King (All full time CS MSc)

###External Libraries:

    mockikto >= 1.9.5
    Junit 4


###Operation:
To start the program, run the class 'BattleshipGame'. This contains the main method.

###Notes on implementation:

We have used the MCV pattern to decouple the user view from the main program, this has also lead to the implementation of a controller for the main game.
